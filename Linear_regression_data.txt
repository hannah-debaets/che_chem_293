----What does the model achieve?----
The model comparing the amount of cat play time (mins) vs 
amount of cat food consumed (g) measures the relationship 
between these two variables within the range of 5 - 75 mins 
of cat play.


----How should metrics be interpreted? ----
Slope (95% Confidence Interval): 0.4866 to 0.7437

We are 95% confident that the true slop falls within the 
range 0.4866 to 0.7437.
95% confidence means that the formula used to derive the 
slope is correct 95% of the time.

R-squared: 0.9680 
According to this model 96.8% of variation in the amount of
cat food consumed is explained by the variation in the 
amount of cat play time (mins)

p-value: < 0.0001

The probability of 

----What are appropriate use cases?----
-predicting cat food consumption at a given amount of cat play time


----How is it implemented? * ----
It is okay to recognize limits of your expertise
It is NOT okay to misuse/misinterpret/misreport!

----What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?----
-only 7 data points
-one cat? many cats?
